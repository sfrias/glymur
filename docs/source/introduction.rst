Glymur: a Python interface for JPEG 2000
----------------------------------------

**Glymur** is an interface to the OpenJPEG library
which allows one to read and write JPEG 2000 files from Python.  
Glymur supports both reading and writing of JPEG 2000 images, but writing
JPEG 2000 images is currently limited to images that can fit in memory.

In regards to metadata, most JP2 boxes are properly interpreted.
Certain optional JP2 boxes can also be written, including XML boxes and
XMP UUIDs.  There is incomplete support for reading JPX metadata.

Glymur will look to use **lxml** when processing boxes with XML content, but can
fall back upon the standard library's **ElementTree** if **lxml** is not
available.

Glymur works on Python versions 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.  Glymur requires
version OpenJPEG version 2.1.0 or higher.
